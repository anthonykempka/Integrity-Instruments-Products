# Integrity-Instruments-Products
This is product information from my old company Integrity Instruments, Inc. which I co-founded in the 1990's. Although Integrity Instruments is now retired as a company, some of the product designs may be useful as a reference design or to gain some insight into industrial-grade engineering.

Integrity Instruments designed, manufactured, and sold electronics for the serial communications, ICS, SCADA, and data acquisition markets. Our products shipped to dozens of countries across the world and were used in countless solutions by thousands of customers. We made many custom variations for many companies from the industrial and defense industries.

Our products had a 100% guarantee. Very few boards were ever returned and the vast majority of those that were returned took direct lightning hits.
