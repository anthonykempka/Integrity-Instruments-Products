# Integrity-Instruments-Products
This is product information from my old company Integrity Instruments, Inc. which I co-founded in the 1990's. Although Integrity Instruments is now retired as a company, some of the product designs may be useful as a reference design or to gain some insight into industrial-grade engineering.

Integrity Instruments designed, manufactured, marketed and sold electronics for the serial communications, ICS, SCADA, and data acquisition markets. Our products shipped to dozens of countries across the world and were used in countless solutions by thousands of customers. Our products had a 100% guarantee and very few boards were ever returned.

Some information you will find include:
- [Schematics](https://github.com/anthonykempka/Integrity-Instruments-Products/tree/main/Schematics)
- Firmware source code
- Software source code ranging from old MS-DOS software to Microsoft Windows software
- [User manuals](https://github.com/anthonykempka/Integrity-Instruments-Products/tree/main/Manuals)
- Design notes to capture the reasons certain design choices were made
