# Integrity-Instruments-Products
Products from my old company Integrity Instruments, Inc. which I co-founded in the 1990's. Although Integrity Instruments is now retired, some of the product designs may be useful as a reference or to gain some insight into industrial-grade engineering.

Integrity Instruments designed, manufactured, marketed and sold electronics for the serial communications, ICS, SCADA, and data acquisition markets.

Some information you will find includes:
- Schematics
- Firmware source code
- Software source code ranging from old MS-DOS software to Microsoft Windows software
- Product manuals
- Design notes to capture the reasons certain design choices were made
